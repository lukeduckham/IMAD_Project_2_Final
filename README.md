IMAD Assignment 2 essay 
Descriptive essay explaining my app 

For our assignment two we had to create an app where people are able to play around with there pets. We had to create and implement buttons for a feed button, clean button, and a play button. It took me a while to get all my coding to work for these actions. I used pass activities for some of the coding as well as some YouTube videos for assistance and I used the module manual to for the flipping of pages. This was meant to be a fun experience building this app and putting it together. I was really tested in this project because some variables and buttons did not work as well as other codes. But throughout the hardships of this project, I managed to find new ways to make my Pet Simulator run and be a fun experience for those who want to use my app. 

 

This was the page I used in the module manual, that helped me turn to a new page from the button click. It took me a while to understand but it worked out fine when I had realised, I was just calling the wrong pages. I had to make a few different pages so that when the user that uses my app will be able to go to the next page. I used the module manual a lot as it really helped me understand the code I was writing, and I feel I have learnt a lot since my first project. 


 
In the above picture is what I used for the flipping of my pages. So when people are taken to the next page of the once they have clicked one of the buttons they will  be able to return to the main menu. This was the coding done for the first page of all my pages and it definitely flips people to the next page and directs them there to show them the menu. 




	 
In the above picture is for my user interface. I wanted to go for a certain style which I did. It was a fun a fun user interface with a white themed background with blue on the side and on the buttons. I used different fonts in through out my app so that it could stand out among the other fonts. I got my fonts from google fonts and I downloaded the Amita Font Bold. It stands out well against the white background and generally catches your eye. After that I had to find my avatar / picture. I started by searching on google for gifs then Pinterest. They both had some nice options, but Pinterest had some of the better gifs. I wanted to start off and have a dinosaur (T-Rex) but we had to have the same avatar in different gifs and none of them were consistent. So, the only gif that suited the theme of my user interface and my overall theme was a blue cat. I gave my blue cat the name Molly. Molly had 4 different gifs that I used to match every time a certain button was pressed.  For example, when the feed button is pressed a picture of molly will show up. 



In the above image taken from my android studio is my page two that is my menu. On this page is still the same Image background with a slightly bigger picture of molly my cat avatar. After that there is a text box that says “Click one of the options below” then it goes on for the three buttons we had. The three buttons are Feed, Clean and play. After clicking one of these buttons, I managed to come up with some code and I used the module manual to take you to the next page where you can see when the image has been changed.                   	

 
On this page is the feeding of Molly. So, in the menu the first button is a feed button and once you have clicked on that button you will be directed to this page where Molly will be feeding. On this page there is also a text box that just states that Molly is happy she why I used the same user interface for all my pages was to make sure that everything was kept constant. In this image Molly is eating all kinds of food and is satisfied with being fed and she is being kept healthy and keeping her happy. 



 

In the above picture on this page is my final page which can be accessed if you click the play button on the second page or menu. It will then direct you here where you will be able to see Molly being played with and see Molly happy. There is also a button that will take you back to the menu. In the gif I extracted of molly for this picture it shows her being played with and her enjoying her time. These gifs show a good visualization of Molly really enjoying herself.
 
This was just some of my coding I used to declare my buttons and then activate them. Using the setOnClickListener then it activated my 3 buttons on the menu page. 
After I had finished all my coding, I put together a video demonstration of my app. In the video I just explained how I came up with certain ideas and how I found my avatar and user interface. In the video I also show how the app works and to show it runs perfectly with no errors on my emulator. It crashed once or twice while the making of the app but all I had to do was change some of the coding because it kept giving me a lot of errors. I made the demonstration video just under 5 minutes long. This allowed to keep it short and simple and on point.
For this we had to put our code onto GitHub. We had to regularly push through our code to make sure it was all working. The reason why I showed the demonstration of how my app works and it actually runs on my emulator is in case it doesn’t when it is on the readme file and doesn’t work when I am being marked. On GitHub I had to make a new ReadMe file and I uploaded everything onto there. Inside my readme file are detailed documents of my code and comments and all the referencing that was taken out of android studio. Inside the readme file will be this document and all the images submitted with the other work. 
So, in conclusion it took a while to put everything together and submit. But it all worked out with an attractive user interface and can be shown in the app. This app ensures a fun time for all users / people that use my app. It can be fun for those who like to be entertained. This app will help challenge people to look after the avatar Molly. This app should be fun for all people and should be attractive for people to look at and truly entertain if people are bored or just want to play with Molly.
